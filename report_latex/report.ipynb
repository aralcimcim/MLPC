    "This is a recording of several sentences that span around military content. The first annotator (ID starting with 114) has described it as \"Military person speaking clearly and distinctly\" while another annotator (ID starting with 946) has described it as \"Calm mature male voice telling coordinates and military news\", \"Rough, a bit aggressive male voice repeating the same phrase 3 times\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Annotator 114 did not separate the audio file into parts to consider the temporal characteristics fully while annotator 946 has divided the annotation into parts to emphasize repetitions in the recording. In terms of the textual annotations, annotator 946 has provided more detail in comparison to annotator 114 who seemed to have generalized the audio content. Both annotators have matching descriptions (946 has provided slightly more detail) when the metadata is taken into consideration; character, coordinates, latitude, longitude, mature, military, rough, screaming, yelling.\n",

Both annotators have provided detailed information as per task description. The texts do match the metadata; argentina, del, forest, fuego, patagonia, rodeo, sheep, shout, tierra, whistle, whistling, blume, field-recording, felix. Both annotators have identified the main occurences in the recording such as \"shouting\", \"field\", \"whistling\" in a similar manner. \n",
