    "Annotator 114 did not separate the audio file into parts to consider the temporal characteristics fully while annotator 946 has divided the annotation into parts to emphasize repetitions in the recording.

Both annotators have provided detailed information as per task description. The texts do match the metadata; argentina, del, forest, fuego, patagonia, rodeo, sheep, shout, tierra, whistle, whistling, blume, field-recording, felix.
